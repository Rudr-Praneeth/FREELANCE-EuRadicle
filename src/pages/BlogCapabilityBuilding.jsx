      <p>
        For decades, organizations have invested heavily in training programs,
        calendars filled, participation high, feedback largely positive. Yet a
        persistent question keeps surfacing in boardrooms and CHRO
        conversations alike: why does performance on the ground change so
        little?
      </p>

      <p>
        The answer is uncomfortable but increasingly clear. Training activity
        has outpaced capability impact. What many enterprises are running today
        are well-designed events, not systems of capability.

        The Training Illusion: Where the Gaps Really Are
      </h2>

      <p>
        Most learning strategies still operate on a flawed assumption, that
        exposure leads to competence. Global research consistently challenges
        this belief. According to the 2025 Global Human Capital Trends by
        Deloitte, nearly 70% of organizations report a critical gap between
        skills developed through training and skills required for future
        performance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Similarly, McKinsey & Company notes that fewer than 30% of
        capability-building initiatives result in sustained behavioural change
        at work.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-[var(--color-primary-mauve)]">
        Designing a Capability Journey
      </h2>

      <p>
        A capability journey is not linear, and it is never one-size-fits-all.
        High-performing organizations design journeys around roles, moments,
        and decisions, not courses.
      </p>

      <p>
        Effective journeys begin with business-linked diagnosis, clarity on
        where performance breaks down, which roles carry disproportionate risk,
        and what “good” truly looks like in context. This is where
        assessment-led insights replace assumptions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rather than broad skill buckets, capability frameworks define
        observable behaviours, decision patterns, and leadership judgments
        required at each level. This creates a shared language across L&D,
        Talent Management, and business leaders.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-[var(--color-primary-mauve)]">
        Build Through Experience, Not Exposure
      </h2>

      <p>
        High-impact journeys blend simulations, real-case application,
        coaching, and peer dialogue, enabling participants to practice in
        environments that mirror actual pressure, ambiguity, and trade-offs.
      </p>

      <p>
        Capability only sustains when reinforced through manager ownership,
        structured reviews, nudges, and data-led tracking, turning development
        from an initiative into a living system.
      </p>

        Rethinking the Shift: From Learning to Capability
      </h2>

      <p>
        Capability building demands a fundamental reframing, from What programs
        do we run? to What must people reliably be able to do in real work?
        This shift rests on three principles.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-[var(--color-primary-navy)]">
        1. Capability Is About Judgment, Not Just Skill
      </h3>

      <p>
        In complex environments, performance depends less on knowing what to do
        and more on deciding how and when. This is why high-impact capability
        models integrate behavioral science, neuroscience, and decision-making
        under uncertainty, not just content transfer.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-[var(--color-primary-navy)]">
        2. Learning Must Be Embedded in Work
      </h3>

      <p>
        Capability grows when learning is woven into daily workflows, through
        coaching conversations, simulations of live challenges, reflective
        reviews, and manager-led reinforcement. Standalone workshops rarely
        survive operational pressure.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-[var(--color-primary-navy)]">
        3. Systems Matter More Than Programs
      </h3>

      <p>
        Without alignment between talent architecture, performance systems,
        succession planning, and leadership expectations, even the
        best-designed learning journeys decay over time. Capability needs
        infrastructure.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-[var(--color-primary-mauve)]">
        Why This Rethink Is Urgent Now
      </h2>

      <p>
        Training programs are not obsolete, but they are insufficient on their
        own. Organizations that continue to equate learning activity with
        capability will keep seeing the same pattern: high engagement, low
        impact.
      </p>

      <p>
        The future belongs to enterprises that treat capability as a strategic
        system, diagnosed with rigor, built through experience, reinforced by
        managers, and measured by performance.
      </p>

      <p>
        That is the shift organizations must now make: from delivering learning
        to building capability that performs.
